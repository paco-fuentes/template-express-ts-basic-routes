# Express TypeScript Basic Routes Template

#### This is a template for backend projects using Node and Express written in TypeScript, with basic routes already defined.

##### Follow these steps to get started:

1. Install npm dependencies by running the command 'npm install'
2. Execute the command 'npm run dev' to run the index.ts file and start the local server on port 4000. You should see the following message in your console: "Server Running: Â¡Hello World from localhost 4000!" 
3. Access http://localhost:4000/ in your browser.
4. Compile your index.ts file into the ./build directory with the command 'npm build'
5. Launch the localhost server with the compiled ./build/index.js file using the command 'npm run start'

To stop the server, press 'ctrl' + 'c' in your terminal.

Feel free to customize and expand upon this template for your specific backend development needs.
